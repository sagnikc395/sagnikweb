### Repository:
Some proofs that I have been writing to learn Coq , are in this repository:

### Background:
I have been recently exploring the areas of automatic theorm proving and as one usually does was browsing some subreddit, according to some [Reddit Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/11qghjx/coq_is_one_of_the_most_fun_and_enjoyable/) , Coq is one of the most fun and enjoyable programming languages that they used. I looked at some examples and those looked like the kind of mathematical proofs I used to do back in my highschool. Sweet! This seems like a good'ol challenge and a good break from doing traditional programming in languages like Go , Python , Typescript, which is what I use for my daily work and projects.

I came across [Mukesh Tiwari](https://x.com/mukesh_tiwari) has a awesome [playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stNeltLW12s&list=PLKdfCSnZFxXHiaYo5vy2Y1hCT6uwzyaTW) on Youtube on Theorm Proving using Coq and has covered it for beginners like me. 


### Automated Theorm Proving :
Automated Theorem Proving (ATP) deals with writing a computer program that can "prove" that some statement (i.e conjecture) is a logical consequence of a set of statements (the axioms).

Given the set of axioms defined, the question to ask is whether the conclusion is logical or not ?
